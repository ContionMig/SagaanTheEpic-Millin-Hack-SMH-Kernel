# Simple Millin Kernel Cheat
[[My Website]](https://mitsuzi.xyz/)

# Important: 
First of all, credits goes to Zer0Mem0ry. He basically supplied the basic RPM and WPM which i had no time to do. The other people such as @wlan ( Love me :3), @Daax and afew others who helped me quite abit. This source is basically to help people learning Kernel and just teaching people on how to make an external using a Driver.

# My Goals: 
My goals isnt to release a complete cheat ( if this gets enough support, i will ) but to make a cheat which VAC will find it difficult to detect. Things like using ObRegisterCallback and other things to isolate and making the cheat untouchable from a ring 3 Anti Cheat (VAC). A side note is that, i will try my best to hide the cheat and my main goal is to teach people on how to make a external cheat using a driver instead.

# Others
Just a thing i am trying to do, testing some things out and so on. This is for a game called csgo and basically are for people how knows what they are doing.

# How To Use:

1) You will need to be in "Testmode", which is extremely easy, just opening CMD using admin and typing bcdedit /set TESTSIGNING ON ( only tested in Windows 7, use google for windows 10 
and no, VAC doesnt check for test mode, not complaining )

2) After that, just load the Driver. 

3) Open CS:GO

4) Go into a game

5) Open the Cheat 

# Features:
